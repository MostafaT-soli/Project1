Hello and welcome to my sample code for DevOps and Infrastructure Engineer, WWPS Global Cloud Lab interview.

The main Function for this bot is to monitor some horses energy ( pegas ) in game called pegaxy 

Game Idea: 
===
*The game is simply horse racing game, you can buy a pega and race with it. 
*Pega can race if they have energy.
*Pega gain 1 energy each hour with maximum 25 energy (cannot get more) .
*The race takes about 2 – 3 minutes to finish. 
*If you have one or two pegas there would be no issues. 
*But let’s say you own 150 Pega you will never be able to race them yourself 
*you can rent your Pegas to others with some percentage. 
*So the bot idea is to monitor those scholars to make sure the pegas did not reach the threshold.
